        text:'Although recent rule changes restrict dispersed camping to designated areas only, (“No Camping” signs are now abundant in many areas where dispersed camping was once allowed, including to the west of Movie Road on Movie Flat), it’s still possible to camp here for free. Most important to know is that a free dispersed camping permit is now required. This is not a reservation-style permit. Instead, it’s an “informational permit” similar to the campfire permits required in California. The goal of these measures is to help minimize human impact in the area. But the new hassle is well worth it. Designated dispersed camping among the large jumbled rocks in this beautiful desert landscape provides insanely gorgeous views of the nearby Sierra Nevada, including Mount Whitney (the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States).',

        text:'Located just 30 minutes from Yuma, this dispersed camping area is basically a sprawling desert environment with plenty of space to spread out. The majority of campsites are large, flat, and level. American Girl Mine is easy to reach off of Ogilby Road which connects State Highway 78 to the north with Interstate 8 to the south. The easiest access is turning east onto American Girl Mine Road out of Ogilby. You’ll start seeing campsites in short order. Although some of the side roads are quite rough (a handful do require high-clearance and 4WD), there are countless campsites just off the well-maintained gravel main road that are perfect for any vehicle, including the largest RVs and trailers. In addition to the quiet camping, recreational opportunities are abundant. These include visiting ghost towns, exploring old mining ruins, rock hounding, and hiking.',

        text:'Look for the unmarked turnoff about 1.5 miles south of Picketts Junction on Highway 88 (Carson Pass Highway). You’re looking for a paved road to the north of the highway that crosses a cattle guard and then turns into an unpaved road. This unpaved road winds its way back through the trees with countless places to pull off and set up camp. Big rigs should stick close to the highway while other vehicles (including smaller RVs and trailers) can head in a bit further. Hope Valley is entirely located within Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. Don’t confuse this dispersed camping area with Hope Valley Campground ($22 per night), a popular developed campground about 2.5 miles to the south. Best of all, you’re just 30 minutes from South Lake Tahoe as well as 45 minutes from Carson City in neighboring Nevada.',

        text:'A huge network of dirt forest service roads branch off of Owens River Road just east of Highway 395, each with countless dispersed campsites. Although there are a ton of campsites to choose from, boondockers should turn north on the side road about one mile from the turn off from Highway 395. These campsites are among the most flat and spacious. They’ll accommodate even the biggest RVs and trailers. Vehicle and tent campers who prefer more privacy should wait to turn off until they pass Big Springs Campground a little bit further down Owens River Road. Like most popular dispersed camping areas, remember that the further you drive in down a forest service road, the more likely you are to find a secluded spot.',

        text:'Painted Canyon is notable for its towering canyon walls. These are particularly beautiful at sunrise and sunset. There’s plenty of room to spread out here, especially if you’re willing to brave deep sand. Most campers seem to set up camp near Painted Canyon Trailhead. However, there are countless dispersed campsites along Painted Canyon Road and its side roads well before you reach the trailhead – just make sure you’re off of the Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation first (it ends about 2.5 miles down Painted Canyon Road just after the first big turn to the north). Painted Canyon is a decent spot for boondocking. Just make sure not to go to deep into the canyon in a big rig. I recommend selecting a campsite before entering the canyon for all but the smallest RVs and trailers. Avoid this area if rain is in the forecast. Not only is the dirt road all but impassible (even with 4WD), but this is a flash flood zone.',

        text:'Nestled high in the coastal hills above Big Sur, this dispersed camping area boasts indescribable views of the California coastline and Pacific Ocean beyond. But to reach these scenic campsites you must first drive Nacimiento-Fergusson Road and then brave Coast Ridge Trail – a very rough, steep unpaved road with lots of tight turns and large stretches of loose dirt. Give yourself plenty of time to make the trek – and don’t even attempt it if the road is at all wet or muddy. High-clearance is a must and 4×4 is extremely helpful. I have seen all types of passenger vehicles here, including sedans, but I strongly encourage only those in properly equipped vehicles to attempt the drive. Definitely avoid coming here in even the smallest RVs and trailers. Seriously though, don’t be that person – if you get stuck, you’ll block not only other campers, but locals who live along the road as well. And, that’s not to mention the damage caused by unequipped vehicles. Even those with high-clearance, 4WD, and appropriate tires need to drive slowly and carefully to minimize damage to the road. Prewitt Ridge, like all Big Sur dispersed campsites, is extremely popular now. Expect crowds, especially on weekends, even in the winter. Campfires are not allowed here.',
